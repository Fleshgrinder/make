# We are using GNU make and thus can use .PHONY or even --always-build (as is
# the default in our config.mk). However, there are situations in which you
# might require the emtpy FORCE goal despite all these options and they usually
# revolve around pattern rule goals that cannot be made unconditional in any
# other way than using --always-build (which might not be what you want) and in
# those cases FORCE is your best friend:

FORCE:

# Execute the body of goals in a single shell. This improves performance, by not
# spawning a new shell for each line, and also allows us to write multiline
# commands like conditions and loops without escaping.

# Ensures that we are using the GNU executables on a Mac instead of BSD stuff.
# This greatly increases portability of the scripts we write. We expect Mac
# users to install these things via brew which is the de facto standard on Mac
# for installing such things.

#   distributed along with it. Nobody should place anything in there.
# * `resources/make/bin` contains make runner specific user scripts. This is

# * `bin` contains global user scripts that can be invoked directly or via the
#   make runner.
